WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES

This system helps you manage and process PDF documents containing agricultural 
data. It organizes files into folders, scans PDFs to extract information about 
land areas, and generates reports based on that data.

Think of it as a digital filing cabinet that can also read and understand your 
documents automatically.

HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM

CREATING FOLDERS

1. Click the "New Folder" button in the sidebar
2. Enter a folder name
3. Choose a parent folder (or leave it at root level)
4. Click "Create"

Your new folder appears in the sidebar. You can create folders inside other 
folders to build a hierarchy.

UPLOADING FILES

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to upload
2. Click the "Upload" button in the ribbon
3. Select one or more PDF files from your computer
4. Wait for the upload to complete

Files appear in the main area once uploaded. They start with "unscanned" status.

SCANNING DOCUMENTS

1. Select one or more files by clicking the checkboxes
2. Click the "Scan" button in the ribbon
3. Choose scan type:
   - Total: scans all pages
   - Summary: enter specific page numbers (e.g., "1-5, 8, 10-12")
4. Click "Start Scan"

The system processes your files and extracts data automatically. This may take 
a few minutes depending on file size. When complete, the status changes to 
"scanned" or "summary-scanned".

VIEWING EXTRACTED DATA

1. Click on any scanned file
2. A modal opens showing:
   - Page-by-page data in tables
   - Summary information
   - Total areas calculated
   - Confidence scores

You can review the extracted information to verify accuracy.

GENERATING REPORTS

1. Select scanned files you want to include
2. Click the "Report" button in the ribbon
3. Choose a template (or use the default)
4. Preview the report if needed
5. Click "Generate" to download the Excel file

The report compiles data from all selected files into a single spreadsheet.

MOVING FILES

2. Click the "Move" button in the ribbon
3. Choose the destination folder
4. Click "Move"

Files are transferred to the new location immediately.

DELETING FILES

Deleted files cannot be recovered, so be careful.

ADDING NOTES

3. Click "Save"

Notes help you remember important information about files or folders. They 
appear as small indicators you can hover over to read.

================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING FILE STATUS

UNSCANNED
The file has been uploaded but not yet processed. No data has been extracted.

SCANNED
The file has been fully processed. All pages were scanned and data extracted.

SUMMARY-SCANNED
Only specific pages were scanned. Partial data available.

================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING SCAN RESULTS

TOTAL AREA
The sum of all land areas found in the document.

IRRIGATED AREA
Land that has irrigation systems.

PLANTED AREA
Land that is currently planted with crops.

CONFIDENCE
A percentage showing how confident the system is about the extracted data.
Higher percentages mean more reliable results.

================================================================================

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

- Use clear, high-quality PDF files for better scanning accuracy
- Organize files into logical folder structures before scanning
- Check confidence scores after scanning to verify data quality
- Add notes to files with unusual data or special circumstances
- Use summary scans when you only need specific pages to save processing time
- Keep folder and file names descriptive and consistent

================================================================================

SWITCHING VIEWS

Click the grid or table icon in the ribbon to switch between view modes:

GRID VIEW
Shows files as cards with thumbnail previews. Good for visual browsing.

TABLE VIEW
Shows files in a detailed list with all metadata. Good for comparing files.

Your view preference is saved automatically.

================================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING

FILE WON'T UPLOAD
- Check that the file is a PDF
- Verify the file isn't corrupted
- Try a smaller file if it's very large

SCAN FAILED
- The PDF might have unusual formatting
- Try scanning specific pages instead of the whole document
- Contact support if the problem persists

DATA LOOKS WRONG
- Check the confidence score
- Review the original PDF to verify
- You may need to manually correct the data in the generated report

SYSTEM IS SLOW
- Large files take longer to process
- Multiple scans running at once will slow things down
- Wait for current operations to complete before starting new ones
